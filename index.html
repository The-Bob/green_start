      <p>Most trips away from home are less than 5 miles. Thirty-five percent of all fossil fuels are burned going to and from work and shopping for dinner and other short trips. By using your bike for commuting or local errands, you can save hundreds of dollars a year and help the planet. It's also good for you, too.
