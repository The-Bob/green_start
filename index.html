      <h3>Ride Your Bike!</h3>
      <p>Most trips away from home are less than 5  miles. Thirty-five percent of all fossil fuels are burned going to and from  work and shopping for dinner and other short trips. By using your bike for  commuting or local errands, you can save hundreds of dollars a year and help  the planet. It's also good for you, too.
