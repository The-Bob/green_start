      <h3>Check out our upcoming events!</h3>
      <p>Missing something to do this weekend? Have an open weekend next month? Want to go camping, but you're afraid to go by yourself?</p>
      <p>GreenStart has something exciting happening every month. Come march in the May Day parade, raise money for a good cause, learn more about the natural environment or just have some fun. That's what we're all about here at GreenStart.</p>
      <p>Many of our events are completely free of charge and don't require preregistration. Occassionally the activities require reservations. Just call the office or drop in . We're always happy to meet new people or see some old faces.</p>
      <h3>Accidental educators</h3>
      <p>The first classes at GreenStart started out as a kind of a do-it-yourself kind of affair. Some members dropped by the offices one day to ask how they should set up a recycling program at their school. Well, it just so happened that Lin had just finished extensive research on that very topic to set up our own office recycling system.</p>
      <p>The next thing you know someone produced a bottle of wine and some cheese and crackers. The next weekend we had 20 students sitting in the same office learning how to separate plastics, glass and paper, as well as a dozen ways to reuse products in creative ways. That first class took place over 10 years ago. Today, we have over a dozen classes and 20 part-time instructors and docents. Keep an eye on the schedule, it changes regularly and new classes are added all the time.</p>
